# Gene-level Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Packag

This R package provides tools for conducting exact tests under the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) with adjustments for inbreeding, represented by the parameter theta. 

## Features
* Exact Testing for HWE: Perform precise statistical tests to assess if a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
* Inbreeding Coefficient Adjustment: Incorporate the inbreeding coefficient through the theta parameter to adjust the equilibrium expectations.
* Logarithmic Calculations: Utilize logarithmic transformations for numerical stability and handling large datasets.

## Installation
