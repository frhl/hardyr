\title{Conditional Probability of Heterozygotes under HWE}
\usage{
hwe_cond_p_het(n, nA, nAB)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer, the total number of individuals in the population.}

\item{nA}{Integer, the total number of occurrences of one allele (A) in the
population. This count includes both homozygotes (AA) and heterozygotes (AB).}

\item{nAB}{Integer, the total number of heterozygous individuals (AB) in the
population.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the conditional probability of observing
the specified number of heterozygotes (`nAB`) given the total number of
individuals (`n`) and the total number of one allele (`nA`), under Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium conditions.
}
\description{
Calculates the conditional probability of observing a specified number of
heterozygous individuals under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) conditions
given the total allele counts. This function is crucial for understanding
genetic variation and allele distribution in populations under the assumption
of HWE.
}
\details{
The function first calculates the number of AA and BB homozygotes
based on given inputs. It then computes the probability expression's numerator
and denominator, utilizing factorial logarithms to accommodate large numbers.
The final probability is obtained by exponentiating the difference between
the numerator and denominator.

The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium principle underpins the calculation, assuming
no evolutionary forces are acting on the allele frequencies (e.g., no selection,
mutation, migration, or genetic drift).
}
\note{
This function assumes that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium,
which may not hold in all real-world populations due to evolutionary influences.
}
\examples{
# Calculate the probability for a population of 100 individuals,
# with 50 occurrences of allele A and 20 heterozygotes.
prob <- hwe_cond_p_het(100, 50, 20)
print(prob)
